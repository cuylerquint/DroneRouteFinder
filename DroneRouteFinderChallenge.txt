Navigating a Drone through an Airport
1.0 Problem Description
The goal is to navigate a drone through an airport in the shortest time possible. The airport is
composed of several interconnected circular roads, and the drone’s position is described by a
road name and the degrees clockwise around the road’s circumference. The drone can transfer
between roads at points of intersection. An example is illustrated below.

The drone is operated using 4 commands:

GO: The drone accelerates at 1 m/s​ 2​ , with a maximum speed of 4 m/s.

STOP: The drone decelerates at 1 m/s​ 2​ until it has stopped.

REVERSE: If clockwise the drone will face counterclockwise, and vice versa.
This operation takes 0.3 seconds to complete and can only be
issued when the drone is at rest.

TRANSFER: [road id] The drone changes roads. This operation can only be issued when
the drone is located at a point of intersection.
This operation takes 0.1 seconds to complete.


2.0 Program Input
Your program will receive a set of circular roads, a set of intersections, an initial
position/orientation, and a destination. The exact format is described below.

[number of roads]
[road] [radius in meters] [number of intersecting roads]
...
[total number of intersections across all roads]
[road_1] [point of intersection on road_1] [road_2] [point of intersection on road_2]
...
[initial road] [initial position] [initial orientation]
[destination road] [destination position]

see test_data.txt to see a example for this format

3.0 Program Output
Your program should output the minimum time in seconds (to one decimal place) required to
travel from the initial position to the final position, along with the commands required to achieve
that time. The drone does not need stop at the destination, just drive through it.

Example:
27.1
GO (25.0)
TRANSFER B (0.1)
GO (2.0)
